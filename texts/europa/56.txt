We were very careful with language [as to not risk being held in contempt of court].”The judge imprisoned Robinson under the assumption that his reporting would cause a mistrial by influencing jury opinion. But since Robinson was reporting on publically available facts – and thus facts already available to the jury – how could this be accurate?And to declare a mistrial, a judge would have to look at what information had been leaked and whether it could have reasonably swayed the opinion of a jury.Since Judge Marson admitted he had never bothered to look into the content of Robinson’s livestream, how could he know that Robinson’s reporting was evidence of jury tampering?And if Judge Marson wanted to keep a public attention away from the trial, he completely screwed that up by fueling an international news story with his arrest of Robinson and his sequential gag order against press coverage.Judge Marson helped Robinson by shining a supernova of a spotlight on the trial which Robinson couldn’t have done alone; in short, Judge Marson created a Streisand Effect.Judge Marson’s very own tactics have contributed to the alleged harm he claims Robinson has done by merely reporting on the trial, and despite claiming he’s defending the due process of those accused at the trial, Judge Marson seems to have actually violated the due process of Robinson.GOT A SPLINTER FROM THE FENCE NIGE?
