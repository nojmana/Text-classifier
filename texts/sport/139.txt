There are a lot of memorial days, we had a school trip to Auschwitz in last grade where we also had the opportunity to talk with a survivor, in History class we learned about WWII 3 or 4 times in 8 years of secondary school. We naturally have laws that forbid Nazi symbols/gestures/etc. These are my personal experiences of course, but I do think it's treated quite equally17 more repliesNowadays maybe, but historically definitely not. There is a thing called Opferthese (victim theory), which argues that Austria was the first victim of Nazi Germany (completely disregarding the fact that the Anschluss of Austria was supported by a large majority of Austrians). It was more or less part of Austrian state doctrine not too long ago and has been used to downplay or even negate the Austrian responsibility for Nazi crimes.Contrary to people here saying yes, it very much is not. Germany is way more open about it and worked it up quite a lot more than austria.2 more repliesIt is (Or was) a pretty cool name. Unfortunately it's tainted2 more repliesI don't agree. The "noble wolf". Really old name, which was used in several variants by old germanic tribes. Like Athawulfs in Gothic or Æthelwulf in Anglo-Saxon. It was a popular name since a very long time. Not only for common people but also for kings.Adolf is just a short variant of the full spelling Adalwolf from Old High German.1 more replySort of but you can change your name by deed poll? Clearly he reached the end of his childhood and said "This is fine, I have no problem with every new person I meet tittering and making the same joke, I'll keep it."1 more replyIf Adolf Hitler was in PESAnyone have the clip of the 4chan PES league where you have Hitler playing and there is Jew playing but he is just a huge nose?I'm sure that will be relevant here.Edit: nevermind found it. https://youtu.be/UAWtwF6jPncdo 4chan still do the soccer cups? i remember they used to stream on twitch it was fucking hilarious but im not sure if the modern day twitch would allow itI don't think they do anymore. Think the last one was 2015.Think I remember seeing /pol vs some other board where pol had stormfront up front and Hitler on the right wing and the other team had someone called rape up front and a my little pony headed player in the back. It's cheap laughs but laugh I did.actually its still going on lol https://implyingrigged.info/wiki/ and to my surprise they are going to stream a cup today in 4 hours "baby spring cup" LOLHa! Wonderful. I'd tune in but would probably still prefer to watch the FA cup final.and apparently after i linked that here on reddit i got banned from that site? wtf LOLDoesn't surprise me. Reddit is somewhat more politically correct than 4chan so they probably don't want redditors being linked to it.3 more replies1 more replyclassic videoThat kit is interesting.

How will the squad look like?Its still completely uncertain. I do trust Bobic and Hübner and their choice of Hütter seems like a very good one.We don't have the money to keep players around if other clubs want them. For example, it is rumored that the BVB is interested in buying Wolf. Thats why the next season is still pretty much in the dark, our team could look completely different again. But I am confident that Hütter can manage a first half of the table performance.2 more replies13 more repliesHis parents must really not have wanted him.

His final target is Russia3 more repliesSo this thread was made three days after the offical announcement, to what? Get some Hitler jokes going?Is that what soccer is about?He goes by Adi too, so this post is purely for the jokes.And hütter barely sounds anything like hitlerThis is why the threads announcing Adi Hütter three days ago were barely recognized.I would have preferred a discussion about his coaching skills, his tactical skills. In a subreddit like soccer. He has won the Austrian and the Swiss League, and people have barely anything to say about him other than a pavlovian "Hitler". Kind of disappointing.It's r/soccer. Did you really expect us to talk about that when his name is 'Adolf Hütter'?I'm not disagreeing with you, but we all saw this coming.6 more repliesDid you know about the racial abuse of the Salzburg fans towards Yeboah when they played Frankfurt in 1994?I heard Hütter was the one who distanced himself clearly from those supporters and he even reported some of them to the police.Indeed. Eintracht Frankfurt has also a significant jewish history, which makes this quite macabre.Frankfurter Kickers, the precurser club that lead into Eintracht Frankfurt, was founded by Walther Bensemann, a jewish pioneer that emigrated 1932 as Hitler rose to power. Club members often were also mocked as "Juddebube" (jew boys).The club today stands for the total opposite of what is depicted here. It is a multicultural-club with players from more than 16 nations. Adi Hütter has no influence on how his parents named him. He likes to call himself Adi - he also trained a multicultural club in Bern.I hope not every future thread will be filled with immature Hitler jokes.
