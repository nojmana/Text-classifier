Start protecting yourself online today with 77% off a 3 year plan by using code JerryRig at https://NordVPN.com/jerryrig TAPPLOCK HAS RESPONDED - SEE BELOW: There is a metal pin inside this lock that is supposed to protrude into the back panel to keep it from rotating. (See 3:47 in the video on the right hand side of the lock.) Tapplock has said my particular unit is defective, and should not have come apart that easily. It seems to be more of a defective unit situation, instead of a poor design situation. Tapplock said they have reviewed the quality control and found no other defective units.  Tapplock will send free replacements to anyone who is able to displace the back-cover without damaging it. AND future batches will also come with proprietary screws. Just wanna keep you all updated! Huge thanks to NordVPN for sponsoring this video. Stay secure! At first glance this Tapplock fingerprint scanning padlock may seem like the way of the future... But is it? Is it secure? Is it safe? There is only one way to know for sure and thats with a review from the inside. Fingerprint scanners are becoming the norm on smart phones and other devices, its no surprise now to see them on a padlock. With a one year battery life, and enough storage for 500 fingerprints, this lock seems super cool. Made from solid metal, the Tapplock is anti pry and anti shim, making it pretty secure... but... but... what if there is an Achilles heel hidden 'round back. Is it possible to physically hack this $100 dollar smart lock? It is. Its great for the gym or something non valuable. But dont lock anything super secure with it. As always, hit that subscribe button so you dont miss any of my future videos, And if Tapplock secures the next version of their lock, or fixes the current version, Ill be more than happy to update this video.
