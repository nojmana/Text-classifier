GIS, HydrologyIntroductionGoogle Earth is a handy tool to browse terrain in any part of the globe. Due to detailed satellite imagery you are able to characterize the interesting area in any line of geographic research. Nowadays the 3D quality imagery is manage to develop across the World, especially in the most populated areas. The 3rd dimension of imagery refers not only to simple objects exist in the geographical space, but also render detailed landforms and terrain declivity of local area.Google Earth engine is known for use eg. landslide location, ground coverage, landform identification, geological features, small-scale topographic features and mainly for interesting places location and the surface inspection.To be said the Google Earth is wide-spread tool in following examples:Every remarked earlier way to use the Google Earth software is helpful in any research sciences and companies.I demonstrated the flood simulation using the Google Earth software for 3 cities: Cambridge  (United Kingdom), Warsaw  (the capital of Poland) and Dresden  (Germany). To manage the biggest flood in those cities I used flood markings and historical data.Appropriate flood simulation can be done by advanced software like flood modeller or global mapper. Software, whichis able to cooperate with numeric terrain model. Using Google Earth to flooding occurrences you can simplify the process, however I am telling you in advance that it won’t be accurate enough.Prons and cons using the Google Earth to analyse flood hazards in your area:+–How to create the flood layer?2. You should receive pop-up window entitled “Google Earth – New Polygon”: in the “name” row put the name of your polygon. You can also add the description below (pic. 2), hovewer You will deal with it a little bit later.3. Drag the dialogue box back into your view (basically you can pick up 4 points only making the square-shaped area of your simulation)(pic. 3,4).4. Go to aforementioned pop-up window and pick up your favourite colour, however it’s good to set the similar to flooding river colour. You can set the opacity also. I advice you to put around 90-100%. Do the same both for lines and area (pic. 5).5. Go to “Altitude” sheet and toggle the “Absolute” option rather that “Clamped to ground” selected as a default (pic. 6,7,8).6. On your left side you can adjust the altitude value. Remember that altitude value 0 m is equal the sea level! To set right altitude value for the area of your surveillence set the cursor into river bed and see the elevation value in the bottom right corner (pic. 9).7. If you can compare your flood in different levels you can copy created layer (right mouse click and select copy) (pic. 11) and paste (pic. 12)  (right mouse click and select paste). Remember to close the box window “Edit Polygon” before! Otherwise right click mouse will modify the shape of your box. Altrnatively you can do this operation in your toolbar where you have your box located (pic. 13). To make your visualisation tidy change the opacity of higher level from 90-100% to e.g 30 or 40% and altitude from 5 m to 3 m (pic. 5,9,14).My examples of flood simulation Cambridge lies in the Cam river valley. The river Cam is a short (64 km-length) lowland river, which didi’t cause a big floods in last decades. The biggest marked flood in Cambridge occured in 1947 and 1973 (pic. 18). However the GIS stuff contains areas inside the city, which are excluded due to flood risk. The best example of this is Midsummer Common and Jesus Green – the lowest situated areas in the city centre.2. Warsaw (Poland)The area, which had been inundated remains silted when flood receding, so pic. 22 shows clearly relation between maximal flood level (layer with 40% opacity) and current flood level (layer with 100% opacity). The layer with 40% opacity showing us the flood’s effect in the central Warsaw. Pic. 19 and 23 shows the situation when flood layer is equal the altitude of Vistula river water level – 78 m above mean sea level. According to the historical measurements the highest level ever recorded of Vistula river – 863 cm was in 1844. Pushing the flood layer 9 m up we can see how the biggest flood in Warsaw could be like (pic. 20,21) then.Last big flood in Warsaw occured in May and June 2010. The highest flooding level was recorded on 22nd May – 780 cm.3. Dresden (Germany)Dresden witnessed the biggest flood recently, in 2002 when flooding level on the Elbe river reached 9,4 m and swamped majority of the Old Town. Many landmarks was totally surrounded by water.According to the Google simulation it’s good to know, that Elbe river water level lays on 104 m above mean sea level (in the vicinity of the Augustus Bridge). To ilustrate the flooding level from 2002 we need to lift up our layer onto 113 m.All simulations has been collated in the animation below: The water reservoir vizualisationThe water reservoir visualization is a perfect way to simulate how your region could be looking when water dam exist. There are many places in the World where countries and their governments are going to build a new reservoirs to protect flooding areas.I would like to give you an example of Kąty – Myscowa water reservoir in southern Poland, which is to be build in the future. This project has been postponed several times, although the local inhabitants are aware that they will have to move somewhere outside the planned inestment.
Kąty and Myscowa are two small villages situated inside the Beskid Niski range in the Wisłoka river valley. The top of dam is planned to have 43 m height, so basically the newly created lake is going to reach Krempna, the capital of the Magurski National Park! (pic. 32).Taking into account, that water level will not be equally high as the top of the dam we can considerate the 356 m as a main water reservoir level. In this case the backwater will be situated around 1,2 km from the Krempna village centre (Pic. 33).Only the easternmost part of the Myscowa village (The Koniec Górny hamlet) should be untouched. In the heat of this situation it will probably turn into a nice summer resort (pic. 34, 35, 36).Unfortunately lack of the three-dimensional view of the small-sized areas outside the high-populated regions eliminates the opportunity of detailed simulation (pic. 38). However this is not needed when looking for this area in macroscale.Besides we should hope that 3D detailed coverage will continue to extendacross the World.Conclusions The flood simulation through Google Earth is the easiest way to check the flood hazard in area of your interest. Instead of advanced software, which demands proper GIS skills to manage the flood using digital terrain mode the Google Earth gives you the quickest and the easiest way to do it. Unfortunately isn’t equally detailed against the professional GIS tools. The simulation of flood risk using the Google Earth software may be handy to seek alternative ways of communication and protection of urban areas in case of flood arise. The ease of methode should allow to check the flood hazard by everyone who uses the Google Earth. Moreover you can use this process to simulate the water reservoir in your interesting  (mountainuous) area.Mariusz KrukarReferences: Links:
