Recently, an international team of scientists went on the world's first survey to explore marine biodiversity in the abyssal waters off the east coast of Australia.The abyssal zone is a layer of the ocean at depths of 13,000 to 20,000 ft (4,000 to 6,000 metres). This zone remains in perpetual darkness. The temperature there is around 36 to 37 °F (2-3 °C) and it's a very food-limited environment. "The abyss is the largest and deepest habitat on the planet, covering half the world's oceans and one-third of Australia's territory, but it remains the most unexplored environment on Earth," said Museums Victoria senior curator Tim O'Hara on the voyage's departure.The researchers divided themselves into two shifts (2:00─14:00 and 14:00─2:00). Tirelessly sending their equipment nearly 16,000 foot deep, they hauled over 100 different species aboard their vessel, the Investigator. Five of them are thought to have never been discovered before!Processing the catch involved separating different species, photographing the creepy specimens to record their colors, extracting muscle samples for DNA analysis, and so on. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) ichthyologist John Pogonoski claimed they spent many hours processing the samples. According to him, the voyage is nothing less than "frontier science" that will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the deep-sea. The scientists are still busy preserving the finds for museums around the world. They will be available for research in the future as well. While everyone's waiting for CSIRO Australian National Fish Conference (ANFC) where names to these faceless critters will be given, scroll down and check out some of the spookiest from the whole gang.More info: nespmarine.edu.au             This bright red spiny crab sports an armour of spikes which protect it from the dangers of the deep.
These are not actually true crabs but related more to hermit crabs – although this hermit has traded in its shell for gnarly spikes.   Museums Victoria    Report  It's a punk rock crab!             The peanut worm (Sipuncula) is a deep-sea worm resembling a phallus.
When threatened, they can contract their long head inwards and look more like a peanut. They can reproduce both sexually and asexually.   Museums Victoria    Report  I was about to say, that worm DOES not look like a peanut but rather like something else.;)             These incredible glass sponges have a skeleton made of a lattice of silica filaments, some of which can be up to a metre long.
They feed by sifting bacteria and other single-celled organisms from the water gently passing over their delicate glass housing.   Museums Victoria    Report  Coolio!             This mysterious little deep-sea coffinfish, with its bluish eyes and red feet, belongs to the anglerfish group. It is potentially a new species.   Museums Victoria    Report  OMG he so sad, put him back in the ocean!             This nasty little bioluminescent shark, with its neatly arranged serrated teeth, inhabits the oceanic “twilight zone” in depths of up to 1,000 metres.
It preys on big fishes, whales, dolphins and the occasional unfortunate swimmer, latching onto them before gouging out cookie-sized chunks of flesh.   Museums Victoria    Report  Please, it's not "nasty." That's a human value-judgement . These things are meant to be doing what they do in their ecological niche. It might not be nice for the prey species, but that's differnt to being "nasty."             Being the dominant predator of the depths isn't easy though: at depths of 1000–2500 metres there is very little food, so lizard fish are few are far between to maximise scarce resources.   Museums Victoria    Report  Pretty sure this guy was in Beetle Juice             This blob fish was collected from a depth of 2.5 kilometres off New South Wales.
It has soft watery flesh and is an ambush predator that lies very still on the bottom, waiting for unsuspecting prey to pass by.   Museums Victoria    Report  whoa it looks like me after eating a lot             With no eyes, the “faceless” fish was found four kilometres below the surface.
The species was first collected in the northern Coral Sea more than 140 years ago during the voyage of HMS Challenger, the world’s first round-the-world oceanographic expedition. It has been rediscovered in Australia after more than a century.   Museums Victoria    Report  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!             These coral organisms belong to the same group as anemones, jelly fish, hard corals and other tentacled creatures of the sea.   Museums Victoria    Report  Hey, that coralimorph could be a match to the peanut worm             The brittle star can be found right across the globe from Siberia in the north to Antarctica in the south, yet we know almost nothing about them.   Museums Victoria    Report  Looks like a curly starfish. Could be related to it?             Dumbo octopus flap their ear-like fins, just like the Disney character of the same name, except this animal flaps its ears to glide gracefully through the deep, dark abyss.   Museums Victoria    Report  THE KRAKEN HAS BEEN RELEASED! :o             Zombie worms (Osedax) are commonly found in the decaying remains of whales on the ocean floor, burrowing into their bones to reach the sustenance within.
With no functioning mouths, guts or anuses, they have bacteria that digest the grisly remains for them.   Museums Victoria    Report  an example of effective management             These alien lifeforms are not actually spiders at all but one of the oldest arthropods to grace planet Earth.
Simplicity is their motto, being little more than a tube within a tube. Many sea spiders have legs that glow in the dark.   Museums Victoria    Report  Ugh... no, no, no, no, no.             These cute little pink pigs, found in the Freycinet Marine Reserve off Tasmania, are the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, using their tube-like feet to move across the abyssal mud and hoovering up micro-organisms.   Museums Victoria    Report  Neither cute, nor pink.             Crustaceans such as this amphipod are deep-sea scavengers and will eat almost anything nutritious they come across – including the decaying remains of a dead whale, drifted down from the world above.   Museums Victoria    Report  Made we tingle a bit             These round discs of concentrated urchin are not actually flat in their natural habitat.   Museums Victoria    Report  Eat up!             These iconic abyssal fishes, often called spiderfishes, prop high off the sea floor on their stilt-like fins.
Like all fishes in the spiderfish family, they have very reduced eyes.
To feed, they face into the current, extending their elongated pectoral fins forward and “feel” their prey items drifting by.   Museums Victoria    Report  Did they kill it?

That's the biggest drawback of being zoology freak. However, this one had lots of species I've never heard of(in fact, like 70% of all)! Creepy but awesome, nonetheless! Thanks for sharing!The deep oceans are still unexplored and this could be just 0.1% of all species in there.Less than 2% of the ocean as a whole has been explored. Lots of discoveries are waiting ahead of us... Unfortunately many of them would be gone before we find them, due to our own stupidity and carelessness.This comment is hidden. Click here to view.Fun how we can just make up numbers like that, isn't it? ;)What do I think? Still, trying to get over some of them! The abyss can keep 'em, ta.Thrilling pictures that show how little of the marine life we know. Yes, the species already discovered represent a tiny percentage of what may be existing down there. The most amazing point is the fact that life can exist in places where the lack of light, scarcity of food and enormous pressure would make you think that nothing can survive these conditions. Nature is truly marvelous in its many inventions and adaptations, and, unfortunately, we are ruining a lot of it without even knowing it or caring to know.It's a very rare occasion to find a list that has animals I've never heard of.
