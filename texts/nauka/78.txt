Its a "boulder" not a "bolder"Yes, and I thought than spelling was easier than sending a spaceship around the moon. Obviously I was wrong.There is only one Hohmann Transfer solution for any given set of launch conditions, but language mutates like a bastard, and the "spellcheck gotchas" don't help.And I thought "that" had a "t" at the end...The mooxers will simply claim this is all CGI directed by Kubrick, produced by Disney, for NASA (paid for by the Illuminati and the Reptilians). --> Sent on my ReptoiPhone from our double super secret base on the dark side of the holographic Moon. Don't tell anybody.Well, at least we would know how crazy they are, given that Kubrick has been dead for almost 20 years.Or has he?!For those who don't want to watch the entire video, the landing site shows up around 3:35 Nice CGINasa used 'Pixar' to produce this imagery,no doubt....lolNah, If Pixar had dome it we would have seen Buzz Lightyear planting a flag on the surface.
