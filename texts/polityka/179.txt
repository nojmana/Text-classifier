Unfortunately, we have reached the point where mentally and emotionally immature adults are bearing and raising their own children.AÂ tale of crypto-hype that even an illiterate can enjoy."You get rich by generating value, not through consumption." â€” Rick RuleEleven GOP members of Congress led by Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) have written a letter toÂ Attorney General Jeff Sessions, AttorneyÂ John Huber, and FBI Director Christopher Wray -Â asking themÂ to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, Hillary Clinton and others - including FBI lovebirds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, for a laundry list of potential crimes surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Recall that Sessions paired special prosecutor John Huber with DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz - falling short of a second Special Counsel, but empowering Horowitz to fully investigate allegations of FBI FISA abuse with subpoena power and other methods he was formerly unable to utilize.The GOP letter's primary focus appears to be James Comey, whileÂ the charges for all include obstruction, perjury, corruption, unauthorized removal of classified documents, contributions and donations by foreign nationals and other allegations.The letter also demands that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "be recused from any examination of FISA abuse," and recommends that "neither U.S. Attorney John Huber nor a special counsel (if appointed) should report to Rosenstein."Â Â The letter refers the following individuals for the following conduct:Â James ComeyÂ - obstruction, perjury, corruption, stealing public property or records, gathering transmitting or losing defense information, unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents, false statements.Â Hillary Clinton - contributions and donations by foreign nationalsLoretta Lynch - obstruction, corruptionAndrew McCabe - false statements, perjury, obstructionPeter Strzok and Lisa Page - obstruction, corruption,Â "Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI personnel connected to the compilation of documents on alleged links between Russia and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump known as the "Steele dossier."Â The criminal referrals for the group allegedly responsible for FISA abuse include: obstruction,Â deprivation of rights under color of law, corruption.Read the full letter below:Â What...No Lois Lerner?Â Holy Shit!!!Lock the corrupt fuckers up.Â In reply to What...No Lois Lerner?

This looks like it might be elaborate disinformation, with the purpose of shielding Hillary for real offenses. Jim Stone at his website gives the Tor link to the alleged Hillary-Huma snuff video, but given his description I didn't have the heart to check it out.

I'd like to think the US' initial proclamation of being an organization "of, by and for the people," (though only described as such "4 score and 7 years"* after the fact), we would welcome the chasing down of those intent on dissolving our common interests in remaining beholden to those principles and welcome the intense persecution / prosecution on all those set on enslaving us once again to base, fearful and otherwise entangling desires / requests / unnatural relations through their use of "Senior Executive Service" agreements and other such unaccountable positions of "authority".jmo.*[I only mention the 4 score and 7 as a reference for you, Mr. Sessions, since you are wont to call to account the event that welded your beloved Alabama to your current NY president's ability to unify carpet bagging, trails of tears, whoremongering, and persecuting those with relatively harmless 4/20 adolescent memories as more threatening than obvious currently roaming, self-proclaimed and celebrated criminals breathing the air you were once breathing, because you're obvious in an iron lung somewhere and unaware of current events.]still jmo.In reply to If this referral gets sweptâ€¦ by Dickweed WangBravo, sir!(Fuckin A there are some smart and well spoken folks on ZH)In reply to ...start of the fireworksâ€¦ by Boxed MerlotThe fix is already in WEED.These people don't go to prison, theyÂ steal more of our money fromÂ a different position.Â Did Lois Lerner go to the slam?How bout the Awan brothers?Â Not a peep.Debbie Medusa Wasserman Shultz?Fuck no they don't.Â Until these pieces of shit go to prison, everything stays the same.Â The only draining going on is our wallets.In reply to If this referral gets sweptâ€¦ by Dickweed WangAll in good time (Seth Rich will be vindicated).Â  This is just the beginning if it actually gets past this first stage.Â Again, as has been stated on the Internet (places like this), the vast MAJORITY of American Citizens are as dumb as a bag of hammers in regard to this information.Â  It needs to come out slowly, so they don't have their brains melt.Â  First a few indictments and arrests and then more and then more.Â  Trump still has 2.5 years left to clean, so lets all hope the cleaning gets done.Â  Once this information and arrests happen, both the Rep's and Dem's are going down.Â  It will be time for the Independent Candidates to take over.Â  Cleaning up something that has taken decades and decades cannot be done over night.Â  It's a simple fact.Everyone needs to just keep talking about what has gone on, even though the SHEEP are hard to argue with.Â  Keep arguing and opening someone's eyes, one at a time.Â  Eventually it will pay off.The problem is the left wing loony's are the ONLY ones that PROTEST.Â  Conservative Red Pilled people need to start standing up for OUR rights more and not let PC get in the way.Â  Let the brain dead fu-ks whine.Â  Who gives a shit what they think anyway.In reply to Notably absent are theâ€¦ by Ms. ErableYet.In reply to Notably absent are theâ€¦ by Ms. Erablehttp://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/04/18/robert-mueller-pittsburgh-polâ€¦"Pittsburgh Police Prepare For Possible Riots In Event Trump Fires Mueller"This is too goddamned good to be true.Â  Trump fires Mueller (destroying an enemy), the libfags riot and burn down the cities WHICH HOUSE ALL THE LIBFAGS.Â  Get millions of enemies to eliminate themselves by our eliminating one enemy.Â  Wonder what Sun Tsu would say about that?It's a goddamned dream come true.Â  What do we have to do to make this happen?Â  Â PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEIn reply to Yet. by Fishthatlivedlol...it's like a twofer!In reply to http://pittsburgh.cbslocalâ€¦ by SWRichmondSir +1,000Â  Oh please from your mouth to God's ears!!
