Dickian GnosticismThe Exegesis of Philip K. Dick.Welcome to the online community of PhilDickian Gnostics. We find Gnosis through visions of Philip K. Dick. We are scholars of The Exegesis, the greatest masterwork that completes mission impossible: describes the experience of Gnosis. You write in the sidebar promo above right that „He [Philip K. Dick] is considered as the greatest scholar within a neognostic school.” My question is: WHO considers him this? What is your source for this information? Thank you for your time and answer.LikeLiked by 1 personAt the moment i could find only one direct quote from Forbidden Faith: The Secret History of Gnosticism by Richard Smoley on page 206 of polish translation. But I could bet that many others would agree, like Miguel Conner from Aeon Bytes, Eric Davies etc. ofcourse i mean scholars active after born of new gnosis at 2-3-74LikeLiked by 1 personSo, what is this “one direct quote from Forbidden Faith: The Secret History of Gnosticism?” Is it the same as that written in the pull quote I cited?? Facts are far more important to provide relevant support for claims that big generalizations supported by a bunch of little generalizations.LikeLiked by 1 personMy reply should read: “…provide relevant support for claims THAN big generalizations…” Doing proof-reading and copy-editing is also important.I know what You mean, but I think one of Dick messagges where “Truth is objective”How to prove that Bethoven was greatest musician? Other can say it was a Mozart, it is just my opinion and other neognostics. Unfortunetly i dont have my library at my new place, so cant give direct quotes. I am not one to decide who is who, i can speak in my opinion or orhwr neognostics i know. Thank You for comments. LoveLikeLikeFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:

Philip K. Dick is the first postmodern Gnostic, author of the most important masterpiece of Gnosticism – The Exegesis. He is considered as the greatest scholar within a neognostic school.After 2-3-74 he became prophet of postmodern Gnosticism. Divine Invasion of Valis filled his brain with massive ammount of informations about true nature of reality. His astonishing knowledge directly inspired most of the living charismatics, creating gigantic wave of new gnostics all around the word with overwhelming population of pneumatics, in never seen before plurality.Felix Rex
