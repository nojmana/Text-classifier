Here's the deal.I haven't updated Atanua for a while, mostly because there hasn't been too much commercial interest in it. Atanua has been mentioned in trade magazines and various electronics websites. Over 100 000 unique users have visited the "downloads" page alone. About 150 schools have requested a free classroom license. About 100 individual students have contacted me asking for a free license. About 60 licenses have been sold during the lifetime of the project for money - almost exclusively always the cheapest available license. Discounts have had no effect in sales. Advertising has had no effect in sales. Attempt to up-sell homework licenses to schools have lead to no sales.Long-time followers of this project may have noticed that I sometimes get active and push a few new versions and then become silent again. These bursts have almost always been caused by some teacher who has fallen in love with Atanua and have wanted some specific features, and I've gotten inspired again.. followed by marketing push, which has always lead to no effect in sales.There won't be any new commercial versions of Atanua (unless someone buys the whole project from me, but that's unlikely).So.First: I'd rather see people use Atanua than not, and since paying money for it doesn't seem to be an option to most people, here's the end of life license key:
